# Project Name

A collection of simple console games written in C++.

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of basic console games implemented in C++. These games serve as a way to learn and practice fundamental concepts, syntax, and techniques in C++. The games are primarily array-based, utilizing both 1D and 2D arrays.

## Games Included

1. Game 1: Description of the first game.
2. Game 2: Description of the second game.
3. Game 3: Description of the third game.
   ...

Feel free to add more games to the list as you create them.

## Key Learning Points

Throughout the development of these games, several key learning points were addressed, including:

- Understanding and manipulating arrays in C++
- Exploring the concept of pointers and memory management
- Utilizing functions to encapsulate logic and improve code organization
- Separating code into header, main, and function files for modularity
- Working with command-line arguments for user interaction

## Usage

To run any of the games, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Compile the desired game using a C++ compiler. For example: `g++ game_name.cpp -o game_name`.
4. Execute the compiled game by running the generated executable. For example: `./game_name`.

Please note that these games are console-based and do not have a graphical user interface (GUI).
