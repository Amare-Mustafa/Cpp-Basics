A collection of simple console games written in C++.

Introduction
This repository contains a series of basic console games implemented in C++. These games serve as a way to learn and practice fundamental concepts, syntax, and techniques in C++. The games are primarily array-based, utilizing both 1D and 2D arrays.

Games Included
Game 1: Description of the first game.
Game 2: Description of the second game.
Game 3: Description of the third game.
...
Feel free to add more games to the list as you create them.

Key Learning Points
Throughout the development of these games, several key learning points were addressed, including:

Understanding and manipulating arrays in C++
Exploring the concept of pointers and memory management
Utilizing functions to encapsulate logic and improve code organization
Separating code into header, main, and function files for modularity
Working with command-line arguments for user interaction
Usage
To run any of the games, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the cloned directory.
Compile the desired game using a C++ compiler. For example: g++ game_name.cpp -o game_name.
Execute the compiled game by running the generated executable. For example: ./game_name.
Please note that these games are console-based and do not have a graphical user interface (GUI).

Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you would like to add more games or improve the existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and provide clear documentation for any changes.
